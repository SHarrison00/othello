# OthelloAI WebApp

## Project Description

OthelloAI WebApp is an online implementation of the classic Othello board game, where users can play against an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm for strategic gameplay. For in-depth explanation into the AI's functioning, refer to the project blog.

## How It Works

OthelloAI uses Python and Flask for its back-end, handling game logic and AI opponent operations. On the front-end, it employs AJAX requests to facilitate communication with the server, allowing players to make moves and play against OthelloAI.
