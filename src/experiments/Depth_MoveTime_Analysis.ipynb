    "#Â Minimax Depth vs Move-Time Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook conducts an exploration to investigate the relationship between the **depth parameter** of the Minimax algorithm and the corresponding **move-time** in Othello gameplay. The core hypothesis is based on the theoretical understanding that Minimax complexity grows exponentially, specifically as O(b^d), where 'b' represents the breadth of the game tree and 'd' signifies the Minimax agent's depth. To empirically substantiate this relationship, we'll gather and analyze move-time data from a series of Othello matches where a Minimax agent competes against Random agents. Through detailed and systematic observations, this investigation aims to empirically validate the theoretically anticipated exponential growth pattern of Minimax move-time with increasing depth.\n",

    "## Theoretical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this theoretical analysis is to establish an understanding of how the Minimax algorithm's move-time scales with varying depths in the game of Othello, particularly focusing on the hypothesized relationship $f(d) = T \\cdot b^d$, where $f(d)$ represents the move-time at depth $d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hypothesized Relationship:** Let $f(d)$ be the move-time for the Minimax algorithm at depth $d$. The Minimax algorithm's time complexity as a function of depth is expected to follow: $f(d) = T \\cdot b^d$, where $T$ represents the average time taken to evaluate one board position, and $b$ is the branching factor, approximated as 10 for Othello [1]. The key aspect of this relationship is its expected exponential nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Estimating $T$, and Extrapolation:** To explore this hypothesized relationship, we plan to analyse $f(d)$ at depth 1 to establish a baseline: $f(1) = T \\cdot b$. Using our hypothesized relationship, and the reported value for the branching factor ($b = 10$), we aim to estimate $T$. We will then extrapolate to higher depths to predict this relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Validation:** After careful estimation, we will perform empirical validation to compare our estimated and hypothesized relationship. This validation will enable us to confidently understand how the Minimax algorithm's move-time scales with varying depths in the game of Othello.\n",
